# GraphTakeHome
For Stable

Prompt:
Part 1
You are tasked with implementing a frontend feature in Swift UI: A graph displaying a user's balance over time. Details on how this graph should look can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKaOHjgvTeVu_P06NunJAVJ_6vDaRIme/view?usp=sharing). We are looking for the feature to have the following properties:

- You should be able to pan on the graph & have a detailed view at that point in time, with a dotted vertical line (as per the liked video).
- You should be able to scroll up and down on the page while your finger is in the area of the graph without it triggering the detailed mode with the vertical dotted line.
- You can use randomly generated data for the graph.
- No API endpoint required to be hit.
- We should be able to toggle between time frames (as shown in the video).
